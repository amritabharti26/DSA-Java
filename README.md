# 📘 DSA in Java – Practice Repository

This repository represents my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey using Java**.  
The primary focus is on **building strong fundamentals, writing clean and readable code, and maintaining consistency**, while preparing for **placements and real-world problem solving**.

This repository is **continuously evolving** as I learn and practice new DSA topics.

---

## 🚀 Current Progress

So far, I have worked on the following areas:

- Java fundamentals  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)  
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, nested loops)  
- Pattern printing problems  
- Methods and basic logic building  
- Problem solving using self-implemented logic  
- Version control using **Git & GitHub**

I am currently starting **Arrays**, with a focus on strengthening core concepts before moving to advanced topics.
